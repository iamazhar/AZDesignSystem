# AZDesignSystem
A design system for iOS development written in Swift to shorten UI development turnaround.

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repo and open the xcworkspace file with references to the design system kit and the demo project. AZDesignSystem has already been imported into ViewController for you to test out.

### Prerequisites

Not exactly a prerequisite but the build target for the SDK and the demo project is 13.0 and up. You can change this to suit your need.

### Installing

Simply clone the repo, select the AZDesignSystemDemo scheme in Xcode to run the demo on a simulator or a device. Since this project is just starting out, this section will likely see changes in the future.
